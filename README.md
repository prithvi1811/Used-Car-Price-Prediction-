# Used Car Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the prices of used cars using various regression techniques and identify the best-performing model based on the lowest mean absolute error (MAE).

## Objective
To develop and evaluate different regression models for predicting used car prices and determine which model performs best.

## Data Processing

### Data Collection
- Gathered data from reliable sources (e.g., online car marketplaces).
- Features included: make, model, year, mileage, condition, location, and price.

### Data Cleaning
- **Handled missing values**: Imputation or removal.
- **Converted categorical variables**: Used one-hot encoding or label encoding.
- **Normalized/standardized features**: Ensured features are on a similar scale.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized relationships between features and price.
- Identified trends and outliers that could affect model performance.

## Model Development

### 1. Linear Regression
- Implemented a basic linear regression model.
- Evaluated performance using MAE, RÂ², and visualized residuals.

### 2. Logistic Regression
- Attempted for comparative purposes (focused on categorizing price ranges: low, medium, high).
- Noted limitations in predicting exact prices.

### 3. Ridge Regression
- Introduced regularization to combat overfitting.
- Tuned hyperparameters (e.g., alpha) using cross-validation.

### 4. KNN Regression
- Implemented K-Nearest Neighbors regression.
- Experimented with different values of K to find the optimal number of neighbors.

## Model Evaluation
Used Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as the primary metric for evaluation. 

| Model               | MAE   |
|---------------------|-------|
| Linear Regression    | X1    |
| Logistic Regression  | X2    |
| Ridge Regression     | X3    |
| KNN Regression       | X4    |

## Conclusion
- **Best Model**: KNN Regression emerged as the best model with the least MAE (X4).
- Discussed the implications of the results and potential reasons for KNN's superior performance, such as its ability to capture non-linear relationships in the data.
- Suggested areas for future work, including exploring other models (e.g., decision trees, ensemble methods) or enhancing feature engineering.

## Final Thoughts
This project successfully demonstrated the application of various regression techniques in predicting used car prices, providing valuable insights for buyers and sellers in the automotive market.
